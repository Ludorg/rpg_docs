# The Dungeon Alphabet 

[The Dungeon Alphabet](https://goodman-games.com/UKStore/product/the-dungeon-alphabet-fifth-printing-print-pdf/) is a compilation of tables with various dungeon elements. This book is written by Michael Curtis and edited by [Goodman Games](https://goodman-games.com), the creators of Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG.

My idea (and maybe another soon tobe side project) is to have an online random generator for each of these tables and to provide translation in french.
